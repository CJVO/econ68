# econ68 -- topics in public economics (pre-thesis course)

Contains my final paper from my Economics 68 culminating experience. Includes data analysis codes. Data sets available on demand.

I studied the impacts of the 1998 reauthorization of the Higher Education Act of 1965 on voter registration and turnout among college-age students. The 1998 reauthorization included a mandate that universities in states without same-day voter registration mail students forms to register to vote. I recorded a modest increase in voter registration but a statistically insignificant effect to turnout.
